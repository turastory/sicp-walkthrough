## 2 - Building Abstractions with Data
- The title of the first chapter was “Building abstractions with procedures”.  
- So the main topic changed from procedure to data.  

> In this chapter we are going to look at more complex data … we turn in this chapter to another key aspect of any programming language: the **means it provides for building abstractions by combining data objects to form compound data**.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q. Why do we need to form compound data?  

> For the same reasons that we want compound procedures: to elevate the conceptual level at which we can design our programs, to increase the modularity of our designs, and to enhance the expressive power of our language.  

By using compound data, we can:  
1. Elevate the level of abstractions while designing the program.  
2. Increase modularity of program designs.  
3. Enhance expressive power of the language.  

- So basically what we can achieve are same as compound procedures.  

> The general technique of isolating the parts of a program that deal with how data objects are represented from the parts of a program that deal with how data objects are used is a powerful design methodology called **data abstraction.**
